# Eidgensi's Dummy Product Tech Test

1. Create a new nextjs project.

2. Using [Dummy API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products), fetch products and render them on the home page.
   Each product should be a card with a title, description, image and a link to its own page.

3. Create dynamic pages for each product.
   The page should fetch data only for that product using the same API
   It should render the same card as on the home page.

You can style this in any way using your own preferred method.

## Requirements

-   All products on home page.
-   Dynamic Pages for individual products

## Stack

-   NextJS
-   TailwindCSS

## What I would have liked to add with extra time

#### Aesthetics

Minimal aesthetics in the alotted time - would have done a better job making it more visually pleasing.

#### Environmental Variables

No real Environmental variables needed, but for a private API I would have used a .env to keep the important secrets secret!

## Experience

This was made in less than 3 hours - and its my first time making a NextJS app, especially with NextJS 13 recently coming out, finding relevant information proved slightly more difficult, but I am still happy with the results.
